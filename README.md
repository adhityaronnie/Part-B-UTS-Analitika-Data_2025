Instructions: Use the dataset assigned to you. Submit one Jupyter Notebook or RMarkdown file containing all code, visualizations, and answers. Comment your code clearly.

Question 1 – Data Cleaning (25 pts):

Inspect the dataset and list all missing values (5 pts). 
Propose and implement suitable imputation methods for numerical and categorical variables (5 pts).
Detect outliers in at least two numeric variables using IQR or z-score and treat them appropriately (10 pts).
Remove or handle duplicate records (5 pts).

Question 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (25 pts):

Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, quantiles) for numeric variables (5 pts).
Plot the distribution of at least two key numeric variables (e.g., premium, claim amount) (5 pts).
Plot one categorical distribution (e.g., policy type, region) (5 pts).
Explore at least one bivariate relationship (e.g., claim amount vs. age) (10 pts).

Question 3 – Predictive Modeling (30 pts):

Build and fit one of the following models based on the dataset type (20 pts):
- Linear Regression (e.g., predict premium or claim amount).
- Logistic Regression (e.g., predict lapse/churn or large claim indicator).
- Poisson Regression (e.g., model number of claims).
  
Evaluate the model (R², accuracy, deviance, or another suitable metric) (5 pts).
Interpret at least two model coefficients in actuarial/business terms (5 pts).

Question 4 – Reporting (20 pts)

Summarize your approach to cleaning, visualization, and modeling (10 pts).
Discuss key actuarial insights and how they could support pricing, reserving, or customer management decisions (10 pts).
